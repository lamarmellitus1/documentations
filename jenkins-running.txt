=================
What is Jenkins?
=================

=> Jenkins is an open source automation tool for CI and CD

=> Jenkins tool developed using Java

=> Jenkins is part of Hudson Project

=> Intially it is called as Hudson then later it renamed to Jenkins

=================
About CI CD
=================

=> CI and CD are two most frequently used terms in modern development practises and DevOps practises.

=> CI stands for Continuous Integration. It is fundamental DevOps best practise where developers frequently merge code changes to central repository where automated builds and tests runs.

=> CD means Continuous Delivery or Continous Deployment.

=> Jenkins is a self-contained, open-source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software.

==================================
Build & Deployment Process
==================================

1) Take latest source code from repository

2) Compile source code 

3) Execute Unit tests (Junits)

4) Perform Code Review

5) Package code as war file

6) Deploy the war file into server

Note: All the above build and deployment tasks can be automated using Jenkins tool.

User Management In Jenkins
==================================

=> In Our Project multiple teams will be available

			a) Development team
			b) Testing team
			c) Operations Team

=> For every Team member Jenkins login access will be provided. 

Note: Every team members will have their own user account to login into jenkins.

=> Operations team members are responsible to create / edit / delete / run jenkins jobs

=> Dev and Testing team members are only responsible to run the jenkins job.


================================================
How to create users and manage user permissions
================================================

-> Go to Jenkins Dashboard

-> In Assign Roles we can add users to particular role


=========
Excercise
========

-> create 1 account for DevOps team member 

-> Create 1 account for Development team member

-> Configure Roles for DevOps team member and Development team member



=======================================
Jenkins Master and Slave Configuration
========================================

-> When we build the Jenkins job in a single Jenkins master node then Jenkins uses the resource of the base machine and If no executor is available then the jobs are queued in the Jenkins server.

-> Sometimes you might need several different environments to test your builds. This cannot be done by a single Jenkins server. 

-> It is recommended not to run different jobs in the same system that required a different environment. In such scenarios where we need a different machine with a different environment that takes the specific job from the master to build.

-> On the same Jenkins setup, multiple teams are working with their jobs. All jobs are running on the same base operating system and the base operating system has limited resources.

-> To overcome this problem, Jenkins provided Distributed Architecture i.e Jenkins Master Slave Architecture

-> Jenkins uses A Master-Slave architecture to manage distributed builds. The machine where we install Jenkins software will be Jenkins master and that runâ€™s on port 8080 by default. On the slave machine, we install a program called Agent. This agent requires JVM. This agent executes the tasks provided by Jenkins master. We can launch n numbers of agents and we can configure which task will be run on which agent server from Jenkins master by assigning the agent to the task.


==============
Jenkins Master
===============

-> Your main Jenkins server is the Master. The Masterâ€™s job is to handle:

a) Scheduling build jobs.

b) Dispatching builds to the slaves for the actual execution.

c) Monitor the slaves (possibly taking them online and offline as required).

d) Recording and presenting the build results.

e) A Master instance of Jenkins can also execute build jobs directly.

==============
Jenkins Slave
==============
A Slave is a Java executable that runs on a remote machine. Following are the characteristics of Jenkins Slaves:

1) It hears requests from the Jenkins Master instance.

2) Slaves can run on a variety of operating systems.

3) The job of a Slave is to do as they are told to, which involves executing build jobs dispatched by the Master.

4) You can configure a project to always run on a particular Slave machine or a particular type of Slave machine, or simply let Jenkins pick the next available Slave.

===============================================
Working with Jenkins Master Slave Architecture
===============================================

===============================
Step-1 : Create Jenkins Master
==============================

1) Create EC2 instance
2) Connect EC2 using Mobaxterm
3) Install Git client
4) Install Java Software
5) Install jenkins server
6) Add Git, JDK and Maven Plugins
7) Enable Jenkins Port Number in Security Group
8) Access Jenkins Server in Browser and Login

===============================
Step-2 : Create Jenkins Slave
===============================

1) Create EC2 instance (Ubuntu with t2.micro)
2) Connect to EC2 using Mobaxterm
3) Install Git client
4) Install Java Software
5) Create one directory in /home/ubuntu (ex: slavenode)

			$ mkdir slavenode
			
=====================================================
Step-3: Configure Slave Node in Jenkins Master Node
=====================================================

1) Go to Jenkins Dashboard
2) Go to Manage Jenkins
3) Go to Manage Nodes & Clouds
4) Click on 'New Node' -> Enter Node Name -> Select Permanent Agent
5) Enter Remote Root Directory ( /home/ubuntu/slavenode )
6) Enter Label name as Slave-1
7) Select Launch Method as 'Launch Agent Via SSH'
8) Give Host as 'Slave VM DNS URL'
9) Add Credentials ( Select Kind as : SSH Username with private key )
10) Enter Username as : ubuntu
11) Select Private Key as Enter Directley and add private key

Note: Open gitbash from your .pem file location and execute below command to get private key from pem file

		$ cat <key-pair-file-name>.pem

Note: It will display private key on Git Bash terminal (Just copy and paste in jenkins)

12) Select Host Key Strategy as 'Manually Trusted Key Verification Strategy'

13) Click on Apply and Save (We can see configure slave)


***************With above steps Master and Slave Configuration Completed***********************

-> Go to Jenkins Server and Create Jenkins Job

Note: Under Generation Section of Job creation process, Select "Restrict Where This Project Can Run" and enter Slave Nodel Label name and finish job creation.

-> Execute the Job using 'Build Now' option

Note: Job will be executed on Slave Node (Go to Job Console Ouput and verify execution details)
